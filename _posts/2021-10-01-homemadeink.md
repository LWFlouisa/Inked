I started making my own classical style ink. This isnt as difficult as you might think. The main thing to worry about is thickness: thicker ink is for brushes, and resembles more oil paint. Thinner ink is more like water color. Often calligraphy pens require a thinner ink or your nib will get clogged.

I prefer sketching on a watercolor paper for drafts, and painting canvases for the final version of my work. In general these are either 8 inch height by 10 inch width or 9 by 12.

I ended up decided it wasnt worth marketing my work to the American graphic novel market. But Im not sure if the BD or Manga market will be any better. The manga market recently started opening up to foreign creators.

You might be wondering: why not just market my work to American manga publishers? Well for one thing this largely limits your audience to those inside the US. Also Im going to be moving outside the US anyway for other career opprotunities, and in my mind its generally better to publish your work at a place closer to you.

There is also the fact I pretty much never read US comics outside of graphic novels, with maybe a few exceptions. And the current division doesnt really inspire confidence.

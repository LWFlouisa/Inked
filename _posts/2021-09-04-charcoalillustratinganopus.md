Charcoal ink dries surprisingly quickly on the right substrate.

Initially I became curious if using charcoal soot and mixing it with vinegar would produce more wet version of when you make charcoal sticks.

In the past I would burn my own charcoal, and avoid a fixative agent as I wanted to smudge it, but these days I found brush and ink creates a similar kind of effect. Therefore I only really need charcoal for shading wood texture, including Guillotine planks.

I suppose a lot of the reason I want to avoid working on licensed characters, is usually I get treated like crap if I do anything thats different in my art.

Whether Im using mixed media ink ( ink that has features of both vinegar and acrylic bases ) or charcoal, it seems like people largely prefer the look of traditional comics.

But charcoal shaded 4 frame manga tends to be the format I prefer, even if that creates a mood of confusion for people unsure whether to take it as a gag manga or serious comic.

If it were a gag comic, decapitation would be a rather odd punchline, especially for childrens books. Which is not really something Im intending, hence the gritty smoky look Im wanting.

At least with webcomics you can make your webcomic unlisted. I generally only do that for practice pieces, however.

Sometimes Ill get a comment on social media either about the file size of an image, or perhaps that I have a wonky microphone. The important take away is they never seem to offer a solution for how to shrink an image, or a specific microphone model. At least in writing communities, theoretically people will have an idea on some suggestions on what you need to fix.

But I honestly cannot say this about people where their entire existence seems contigent upon reverse engineering every single thing I say on places like Twitter or comicfury. Sometimes the surface details is all there really is to it. I suspect this is do to idealogy creeping into nerd culture spaces. Though exactly what idealogy this is I cant say for sure.

I spent my last few months having to block comicsgate types on my twitter. Some of them are so determined they even try stalking me on other places. And then blame you for blocking them. I tried explaining this to my parents, but dad always interupts and says he doesnt want to hear about stupid people. Without realizing he is participating in the exact problem Im describing.

For to long now the voices of actual trans women, and not tucutes, have been ignored. In fact to me Tucutes have actually made life worse for actual trans women. And usually their head is shoved so far up their ass theyll never admit to this.

Webcomic sites are the only place I feel safe online, as American nerd culture is completely litered with idealogues, both of the far left and far right varieties.

I simply dont need people trying to eliminate yet another social media site for me to use, simply because theyre blissfully unaware that CF is my only option besides making my own website.

Im not going to shrink images to an improbably small degree just to please some guy that reads stick figure comics. He should be blaming American comics for being a toxic work environment.

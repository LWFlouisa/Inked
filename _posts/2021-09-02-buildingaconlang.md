I had initially difficult road building my first conlang, mostly it was difficult sorting the coffee beans from the chaff. I kept running into people that felt like there was only one right way to build a fictional language. The problem is real world languages never came about with formal methodologies.

I did find useful learning the distinction between syllabaries and pictographs, even though at least for now I may not end up using them, as I intend Fraponic to be derived from the French language. This means that the majority of the grammar uses alphabets rather than syllabaries.

I do plan on developing a kind of verticle collumn writing syllabary at some point, although this isnt necessarily going to be like Japanese. Probably the pictographs and syllabaries will be based on things familiar on the American continent, sense that is where the Fraconic languages would be spoken.

One thing similar to Japanese, however, is the grammar order. The grammar order is as follows:

gender, noun, adjectives, conjunction or preposition, verb, adverb, punctuation.

However spoken order will be signifocantly moee loose. I will however be introducing a significant amount of Japanese vocabulary.
